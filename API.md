# API

JSON API under `/api`. The same server serves the website (`/`) and the
admin (`/admin/`), which only use these routes. With FastAPI, the interactive
documentation is at `/docs`.

Dates and times are local festival time, without time zone:
`2027-06-11` for a day, `2027-06-11T21:00` for a moment.

| `GET /api/venues`            | list of venues, in the order they were added                                                                   |

| `GET /api/programme`         | performances in programme order; filters `?day=2027-06-11`, `?venue=le-kiosque`                                |

## Write (admin)

| Method and path                            | Body                             | Success                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `POST /api/artists`                        | `{"name", "bio"?, "photo_url"?}` | 201, the artist          |
| `POST /api/performances`                   | a performance (below)            | 201, the performance     |
| `PUT /api/performances/{id}`               | a performance (below)            | 200, the new performance |
| `DELETE /api/performances/{id}`            | none                             | 204                      |
| `POST /api/performances/{id}/participants` | `{"name"}`                       | 201, the workshop        |

A performance body has the saved fields only (no `id`, `end`, `summary`…):

```json
{
  "kind": "lineup",
  "title": "Gala",
  "venue": "grand-casino",
  "start": "2027-06-10T20:30",
  "duration_minutes": 90,
  "host": "paul-kerbrat",
  "acts": ["nora-lebrun", "max-pellerin"]
}
```

`PUT` can move a performance to another venue or time: its `id` changes, and
the answer gives the new one. If the new version breaks a rule, nothing
changes.

Every change is saved to the data file at once.

## Errors

Errors of the festival answer `{"detail": "a sentence for the user"}`:

| Status | When                                                                           |

| 422    | invalid value: empty name, duration out of range, not a workshop…              |
| 500    | the data file cannot be read or written                                        |

A body or parameter of the wrong shape (missing field, `"day=June 11"`) is
refused by FastAPI with a 422 whose `detail` is a list of problems.
